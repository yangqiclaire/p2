## Description
This application generates a xkcd password. The users specify how many words to generate, whether to add a symbol or a number. The maximum number of word is set to 6. The default number of word is 2. A random two-word password will be displayed when the user first visits the site. The description of xkcd is on the left of the website, including a link to the xkcd passord comic.

## Details for teaching team
I have also set server-side validation for the number of words. So the user cannot simply hack the site by changing the number of words, or max/min numbers of words.
